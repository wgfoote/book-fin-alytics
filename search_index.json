There are two decisions that financial managers make: investment and raising funds to make an investment. It turns out that the simple rule of invest in what creates more value for stakeholders is the fundamental and most useful rule for making financial decisions. There are many analytical techniques financial managers use to calculate value. Statistics and optimization rank high on the list of broadly available techniques. The book covers various areas in the financial industry, from analyzing credit data (credit card receivables), to studying global relations among macroeconomic events, to managing risk and return in multi-asset portfolios. The topics in the book employ a wide range of techniques including non-linear estimation, portfolio analytics, risk measurement, extreme value analysis, forecasting and predictive techniques, and financial modeling. 1.1 The basic problem The premises of this book include the following chain of reasoning: Financial decisions occur in the context of markets Markets determine value Value can change abruptly, or not, due to changes in information among market participants The interaction of market volatility with financial decisions changes market value Since all financial decisions occur in markets (both overt and latent), the market value of an asset (or liability) is its present value. However, market volatility depends on changes in forces (and information) that drive value. For most organizations revenue, cost, and assets drive value. Thus to the extent that information changes these drivers, so does it change value. How can we analyze changes in market value? The finance in financial analytics boils down to answering four questions about value and volatility: How do we measure the interactions of risk and return in multiple markets? Given the interactions of risk and return in assets and liabilities, what is the combination of assets and liabilities that return the highest value for the risk? Given this combination (a portfolio) what is amount of capital needed to support the portfolio? Given risk tolerances and thresholds for loss, how much cash should be held on the balance sheet? We will be taking great pains to define exactly what we mean by risk (think of standard deviation) and return (a rate of change of value). 1.2 Analytics By its very nature the science of data analytics is disruptive. That means, among many other things, that much attention should be paid to the scale and range of invalid, as yet not understood, outlying, and emerging trends. This is as true within the finance domain of knowledge as any other. Outliers are where value is gain and lost. Spikes in interest rates, commodity prices, information about the reputation of an organization, as well as the doldrums of a very slow news day, are all deviations from a supposed trend. Finance lives in the deviation from the trend. Analytics, especially statistically based techniques, is all about the analysis of deviations from current and projected beliefs, otherwise known as the trend. Throughout the book, we will learn the core of ideas of programming software development to implement financial analyses (functions, objects, data structures, flow control, input and output, debugging, logical design and abstraction) through writing code. We will learn how to set up stochastic simulations, manage data analyses, employ numerical optimization algorithms, diagnose their limitations, and work with and filter large data sets. Since code is also an important form of communication among analysts, we will learn how to comment and organize code, as well as document work product. This book supports the notion that coding as the best path to data analytics. Coding gives us the ability to tackle the most complex problems, because code is flexible, reusable, inspectable, and reproducible. Throughout this book the R programming language is ussed as the lingua franca of financial analytics. Yes, Python is widely used as well; so is Julia, and less so C++ and even less than that FORTRAN. All have their operational place according to the maxim use what works (and also makes us happy). The R programming language has a large following in the statistical and optimization user side of many domains, including finance. This makes it a natural enviornment to start financial analytics on the R programming platform. The RStudio integrated development environment (IDE) continues to develop resources for cross-language collaboration, mirroring the membership of most data analytics teams. 1.3 Why this book? There are many data analytics books available, but only a few devoted to the finance domain. Among these are Ruppert and Matteson (2015) and (???) supported by package Pfaff and McNeil (2016). The first uses a statistically topical approach and is invaluable as a reference with copious R examples. This book takes a different approach by starting with financial decision topics and then applying typically practiced and useful techniques from data analytics and optimization to analyze results. QRM also takes a topical finance approach while using a much more mathematically oriented framework than countenanced in this book. 1.4 A useful way to start: private placement finance The best way to learn any discipline is to build out a practical example. Here is such an example from the work of privately placing financings in a transnational environment. The financing uses multiple markets, with valuation and yields analysis, requiring portfolio management, hedging, and capital requirements. Perfect for our purposes. This example, and many others like it, can serve as the independent way to build an arsenal of techniques practically applied. Key questions that relate to this example are located at the end of each of the chapters. 1.4.1 The market for private placement The dual-currency private placement market arises for several reasons: Investors with excess cash crave higher returns Higher returns occur in higher risk countries than the investor’s domicile Borrowers are not large enough or diversified enough to access public capital markets Some borrowers require non-disclosure of financial activity Issuers (borrowers) will usually have a lower credit rating than investors (lenders) The private placement market had a banner year in 2017 with growth continuing into 2018 and beyond. Importantly there is an increased investor appetite for sub-investment grade paper with good credit stories and inherent guarantees. Since the bulk of investors are insurers, the National Association of Investment Commissioners (NAIC) requires capital charges assessed against risk weighted assets. Sub-investment grade assets might require more capital and thus more return for the insurer-investor. NAIC reports that U.S. insurers held more than $370 billion in privately placed securities with NAIC credit ratings of 1 or 2. The private placement market provides financing for projects that could not be financed on the public side of the capital markets. Decisions to lend are made on the basis of the initial credit quality of the issuer and negative covenants and other protections, such as parental guarantees and swap indemnification. Because information about the issuer, the issue and the financed projects are not publicly disseminated, private placements tend to be less liquid than publicly traded bonds. Insurers have the financial and legal sophistication to assess the issuer’s credit risk and the other risks presented by the issuers, the issue and the project. Insurers and their bankers will be able to negotiate protections for their loans. Insurers need long-term assets like bonds to match long-term claims liabilities. Thusthey can hold relatively illiquid assets like private placements to maturity, with higher coupons to compensate for illiquidity. Insurers can also monitor the performance of these assets, using covenants and other contractual protections to manage deteriorations in the credit quality of the issuer/borrower in a way which has, over time and collectively, resulted in much lower default rates for this asset class than for comparable publicly traded bonds. Banks play a non-conventional role in this market. Typically a lending officer asks “Does this borrower’s cash flow requirements match our bank’s financing criteria?” In the private placement market the bank as intermediary asks instead “How can this borrower’s financing requirements be structured to be acceptable to some investor?” The investor might, and often is, not a client of the bank. Since the search for returns carries lenders and borrowers across borders, currencies will often need to be swapped. Swaps will need to be indemnified with collateral. Issuer default will need to be insured with stand-by letters of credit and credit default swaps. Banks are in the regular business of providing these services. 1.4.2 A deal emerges from the mist There are three primary players in this deal: The borrower in this example is an energy services company that operates in Cameroon and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a U.S. domiciled company. The subsidiary requires 10 year fixed-rate XAF debt to build facilities, expand technical resources, and participate in regional renewable energy initiatives. The U.S. parent is rated BBB+. The investor is a U.S. insurer rated A- that is looking for 10-year floating rate USD. Regulators require the insurer to invest in A- rated or better paper. The intermediary is the U.S. branch of a French bank. The French bank is exposed to XAF currency and has branches throughout the Central African region. The bank also clears funds for the XAF issuer Bank of the Central African States. It seeks 2- to 7-year EUR floating rate investments. The bank will lend to any secured credit priced in liquid markets. Can these three counterparties agree to a structure? Using the entries in this table to assess if borrower terms might be acceptable (“yes”) or not (“not”) to these counterparties. table &lt;- matrix(&quot;&quot;, nrow = 4, ncol = 2) colnames(table) &lt;- c(&quot;French Bank&quot;, &quot;U.S. Insurer&quot;) rownames(table) &lt;- c(&quot;maturity&quot;, &quot;credit&quot;, &quot;rate&quot;, &quot;currency&quot;) table[1, 1] &lt;- &quot;no&quot; table[1, 2] &lt;- &quot;yes&quot; table[2, 1] &lt;- &quot;yes&quot; table[2, 2] &lt;- &quot;no&quot; table[2:4, 2] &lt;- &quot;no&quot; table[3, 1] &lt;- &quot;no&quot; table[4, 1] &lt;- &quot;yes&quot; table %&gt;% kable() %&gt;% kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(&quot;striped&quot;, &quot;hover&quot;), full_width = F) French Bank U.S. Insurer maturity no yes credit yes no rate no no currency yes no A deal indeed might emerge. Analysts for each of the counterparties will trawl through historical data, interview one another in a due diligence process, gear up attorneys, accountants, tax professionals, energy experts, and in-country contacts. They will examine the feasibility of the many legs of the deal to offer favorable and competitive returns for the risk. At the least they will develop cash flows, net present values, and internal rates of return in their analysis. In the end they will end up asking the four questions of this book. There are USD, XAF, energy commodity, bonds, and swap markets interacting dynamically across risk and returns. Given these intertwined risks and returns, each private placement participant must allocate funds across multiple markets. Given these allocations, each private placement participant must account for the appropriate level of capital given return requirements and the range of risks in this arrangement. In the end each participant will need to adhere to their own risk tolerance and loss thresholds to determine the amount of cash needed in their balance sheets. An appendix contains some key financial and statistical concepts with measurements to aid our quest. 1.5 Data All of the data in this book comes from R packages or from the zipped file you can . Set up a working directory on your computer. Typically this is located in the user’s documents directory. In this working directory you will save *.Rmd files. Within the working directory, set up a data directory called data. This is a subdirectory of your working directory. Download all of the data into the /data directory on your computer. You will be accessing this data, for the most part CSV (comma separated values) files using, as an example, the following code. Be sure to set up your files in a directory, then set the working directory as the source file location. In that way your call to /data/metals.csv (for example) will connect. Otherwise you will get the following error: Error in file(file, &quot;rt&quot;) : cannot open the connection In addition: Warning message: In file(file, &quot;rt&quot;) : cannot open file &#39;data/metals.csv&#39;: No such file or directory The fix is to properly set your working directory. In Rstudio on the tool bar go to Session &gt; Set Working Directory &gt; Source File Location. If you have set up the data/ folder with the data as a sub-direcctory of the directory which is your source file location, read.csv() will be able to connect to your data set. An even better fix is to set up a project site as your working directory. In RStudio simply go to File then New Project and follow the dialog boxes. 1.6 Chapter Outline Here is an outline of topics covered by chapter. 1. Preliminaries.
